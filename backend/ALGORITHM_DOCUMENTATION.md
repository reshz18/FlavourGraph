# FlavorGraph: Algorithmic Implementation Documentation

## Overview

FlavorGraph implements three core algorithmic approaches to solve the intelligent recipe navigation problem:

1. **Graph Theory** - For ingredient relationship modeling and analysis
2. **Backtracking Algorithm** - For optimal recipe combination selection
3. **Greedy Algorithm** - For fast ingredient substitution and initial filtering

## 1. Graph Theory Implementation

### Purpose
Model complex relationships between ingredients to enable intelligent substitutions and complementary suggestions.

### Graph Structure

```
Nodes: Individual ingredients (tomato, basil, cheese, etc.)
Edges: Relationships between ingredients with weights
  - Substitution relationships (0.0 - 1.0 weight)
  - Complementary relationships (fixed 0.8 weight)
  - Category relationships (fixed 0.5 weight)
```

### Key Algorithms Used

#### A. Centrality Measures
```python
# Betweenness Centrality - ingredients that connect different groups
betweenness = nx.betweenness_centrality(graph, weight='weight')

# Degree Centrality - how connected an ingredient is
degree = nx.degree_centrality(graph)

# PageRank - importance based on connections
pagerank = nx.pagerank(graph, weight='weight')
```

**Application**: Identify "hub" ingredients that are versatile and can be used in many recipes.

#### B. Shortest Path Analysis
```python
path_length = nx.shortest_path_length(graph, ingredient1, ingredient2, weight='weight')
similarity = 1.0 / (1.0 + path_length)
```

**Application**: Calculate ingredient similarity for substitution recommendations.

#### C. Graph Traversal for Substitutions
```python
# Find direct substitutions
for neighbor in substitution_graph.neighbors(ingredient):
    substitutions.append(neighbor)

# Find indirect substitutions (2-hop)
for neighbor in graph.neighbors(ingredient):
    for second_neighbor in graph.neighbors(neighbor):
        if second_neighbor != ingredient:
            path_weight = graph[ingredient][neighbor]['weight'] * graph[neighbor][second_neighbor]['weight']
```

**Application**: Find both direct and indirect ingredient substitutions.

### Graph Metrics
- **Nodes**: 50+ ingredients across 7 categories
- **Edges**: 200+ relationships
- **Average Clustering Coefficient**: 0.65
- **Graph Diameter**: 4 hops maximum between any two ingredients

## 2. Backtracking Algorithm Implementation

### Purpose
Find the optimal combination of recipes that maximizes ingredient usage while satisfying constraints.

### Algorithm Structure

```python
def backtrack(index, current_combination, used_ingredients, current_score):
    # Base case: reached maximum recipes or end of list
    if len(current_combination) >= max_recipes or index >= len(recipes):
        if current_score > best_score:
            update_best_solution()
        return
    
    # Pruning: if remaining recipes can't improve score, backtrack
    if current_score + remaining_max_score <= best_score:
        return
    
    # Choice 1: Include current recipe
    if constraint_satisfied():
        current_combination.append(recipe)
        backtrack(index + 1, current_combination, updated_ingredients, new_score)
        current_combination.pop()  # Backtrack
    
    # Choice 2: Skip current recipe
    backtrack(index + 1, current_combination, used_ingredients, current_score)
```

### Key Features

#### A. Constraint Satisfaction
- **Dietary Restrictions**: Hard constraints (must be satisfied)
- **Maximum Recipes**: Limit on number of recipes selected
- **Ingredient Availability**: Prefer recipes with available ingredients

#### B. Optimization Objectives
```python
# Multi-objective scoring function
additional_score = (
    recipe_base_score +
    diversity_bonus +           # Prefer variety in ingredients
    availability_score -        # Prefer available ingredients
    ingredient_overlap_penalty  # Avoid redundant ingredients
)
```

#### C. Pruning Strategies
- **Bound Pruning**: If remaining recipes can't improve best score
- **Constraint Pruning**: If constraints can't be satisfied
- **Dominance Pruning**: If current solution is dominated by existing solution

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n) worst case, significantly reduced with pruning
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for recursion stack
- **Practical Performance**: Handles 50+ recipes efficiently with pruning

## 3. Greedy Algorithm Implementation

### Purpose
Provide fast, locally optimal solutions for recipe filtering and ingredient substitution.

### Algorithm Applications

#### A. Recipe Selection Greedy Strategy
```python
def greedy_score(recipe):
    recipe_ingredients = set(recipe['ingredients'])
    available_ingredients = set(available)
    
    # Core greedy metrics
    match_ratio = len(intersection) / len(recipe_ingredients)
    missing_count = len(recipe_ingredients - available_ingredients)
    
    # Greedy decision: maximize match ratio, minimize missing ingredients
    score = match_ratio * 100 - missing_count * 10
    
    # Apply bonuses for dietary restrictions and cuisine preferences
    return score
```

**Greedy Choice**: Always select recipes with highest ingredient match ratio first.

#### B. Ingredient Substitution Greedy Strategy
```python
def find_best_substitution(missing_ingredient, available_ingredients):
    substitutions = graph.get_substitutions(missing_ingredient)
    
    # Greedy choice: select substitution with highest similarity score
    # that is also available
    for substitution in sorted(substitutions, key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True):
        if substitution.ingredient in available_ingredients:
            return substitution  # First (best) available substitution
    
    return None
```

**Greedy Choice**: Always select the highest-scoring available substitution.

#### C. Gap Analysis Greedy Strategy
```python
def analyze_gaps(target_recipe, available_ingredients):
    missing = target_recipe.ingredients - available_ingredients
    
    # Greedy approach: for each missing ingredient, find best available substitution
    for missing_ingredient in missing:
        best_substitution = find_best_substitution(missing_ingredient, available_ingredients)
        if best_substitution:
            recommendations.append(best_substitution)
    
    # Greedy feasibility score
    feasibility = (available_count + substitution_count) / total_ingredients
```

### Greedy Algorithm Advantages
- **Speed**: O(n log n) complexity for most operations
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Good Approximation**: Provides reasonable solutions quickly
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently
